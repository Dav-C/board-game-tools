Board game tools is a collection of small applications to help when playing boardgames!

Install:
-Clone the repo

-install requirements.txt

-manage.py migrate...might be necessary

-create a superuser

-login to the admin and associate the super user with a user profile

-go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/login and login with the super user

-create a new session with the + button

-add a tool to your session using the drop down menu (only the HP trackers are available right now)

the app is designed to be responsive and currently looks best when viewed on a phone. Use the Chrome dev tools and
change the display to iphone for the best experience.
